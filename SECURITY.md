## Security Best Practices

When using perflock:

1. **Keep dependencies updated**: Regularly update to the latest version
2. **Review configuration**: Ensure performance contracts don't expose sensitive timing information
3. **CI/CD security**: Protect your `NPM_TOKEN` and other secrets in GitHub Actions
